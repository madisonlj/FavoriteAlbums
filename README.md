A beginner database project of mine:

I decided to test out my basic sql skills by building a small database. Music is a strong interest of mine, so I chose this type of data set to focus on.

The "Tables" branch contains code for how I constructed the tables.

The "Columns" branch contains code for how I inserted data into the tables.

In the "Queries" branch you will find examples of realistic questions one can ask about pulling and displaying data from this particular database, as well as the syntaxes used to do so.
